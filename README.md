# spell-search

## Notice
This is a super sloppy, learn as I went, state. I will eventually clean up code and fix bugs, but for now, it's pushable.

### TODO:
1. a lot
1. allow users to delete spells from spell books
1. allow the user to delete characters
1. make the UX more apparent
    1. user must create a character and then click its name to "activate" that character before they can add spells from the spell book
